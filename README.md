Description for my project is : This project is a real-time chat application frontend built using Vue 3 and Vite. It features a fully responsive chat interface designed for both desktop and mobile screens. The application includes modern UI elements such as user avatars, dark/light mode toggle, and an integrated emoji picker powered by the emoji-mart library. Messages are stored locally to simulate real-time interaction, and smooth animations using Framer Motion (or Vue transitions) are implemented for better user experience. The project is structured in a modular way with reusable components for easy scalability and maintenance. This chat app is perfect for showcasing frontend skills, real-time UI handling, and Vue component design.

Technologies used:

Vue 3 with Composition API

Vite for fast build and dev environment

CSS (with Flexbox/Grid) for responsive layout

emoji-mart for emoji picker

LocalStorage for temporary message history

JavaScript for state and interaction handling
